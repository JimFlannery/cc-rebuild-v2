# ConditionCover

**Space-weather risk hedging on Solana.**

ConditionCover is a decentralised platform that lets users create and trade insurance-like contracts that pay out automatically when geomagnetic or solar indices (Kp, Dst, Solar X-Ray Flux, Proton Flux, Solar Radio Flux) cross user-defined threshold levels. Contracts are settled by a custom oracle reading live NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center data, with funds held and transferred on the Solana blockchain.

This repository is a full rebuild of [ConditionCover.com](https://conditioncover.com), replacing the original AWS Amplify / DynamoDB backend with Solana smart contracts, a Chainlink-compatible oracle, and a MySQL database.

## How It Works

1. A **Hedge party** pays a premium and receives a payout if a specified space weather event occurs (e.g. Kp-Index ≥ 5 or Dst < −850 nT).
2. A **Cover party** collects the premium as yield and absorbs the loss if the event occurs.
3. A **custom oracle** polls NOAA SWPC data on a continuous basis and automatically settles the on-chain contract when a threshold is crossed or the contract expires.
4. All collateral is held in escrow on Solana (USDC or SSTM) and transferred to the winner without manual intervention.
5. **Yield Boost** allows Cover parties to amplify returns via delta-neutral looping — the platform treasury issues SSTM loans to fund additional looped contract pairs.

## Repository Structure

This is a monorepo containing all three platform components.

```

| Oracle | Custom off-chain adapter — NOAA SWPC + Kyoto WDC data feeds |
| Price Feeds | Chainlink Data Feeds SDK v2 (direct Solana account reads) |
| Database | MySQL 8 |

## Space Weather Indices

Contracts can be written against any of the following indices:

| Index | Source | Unit | Payout condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Kp (Planetary K-Index) | NOAA SWPC | 0–9 scale | `Kp ≥ threshold` |
| Dst (Disturbance Storm Time) | Kyoto World Data Center | nT | `Dst < threshold` (negative storms) |
| Solar X-Ray Flux | NOAA GOES | W/m² | `flux ≥ threshold` |
| Solar Proton Flux | NOAA GOES | pfu (≥10 MeV) | `flux ≥ threshold` |
| Solar Radio Flux (F10.7) | NOAA SWPC | sfu | `flux ≥ threshold` |

**Fixed-point encoding:** `IndexLevel` is stored as an integer ×100 both on-chain and in MySQL. The oracle divides by 100 before comparing. E.g. Kp 7.0 → `700`; Dst −850 nT → `−85000`.

## Authentication & Access

The site is publicly browsable. Full trading access requires three steps in sequence:

| Step | Requirement | Unlocks |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Register / Login (Better Auth) | Profile, order history |
| 2 | KYC / AML verification (third-party — not yet live) | Connect Wallet button |
| 3 | Connect Phantom wallet | Create and manage orders |

`kycVerified` defaults to `true` in `website/lib/auth.ts` during development — flip to `false` before launch.

## Development Setup

Each component has its own setup guide in its subdirectory `CLAUDE.md`.

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | 20.x | Website, Oracle |
| Rust | 1.94.0 | Smart contracts |
| Solana / Agave CLI | 3.1.11 | Smart contracts |
| Anchor CLI | 0.32.1 | Smart contracts |
| MySQL | 8.x | Website, Oracle |
| Phantom | latest | Testing wallet flows |

> Smart contract development requires **WSL2 (Ubuntu 22.04)** on Windows.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Website
cd website && npm install && npm run dev

# Oracle
cd oracle && npm install && cp .env.example .env
# fill in .env, then:
npm start

# Smart contracts (WSL2 — set PATH first)
export PATH="/home/jimf/.cargo/bin:/home/jimf/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"
cd smartcontracts && anchor build && anchor test
```

### Website Environment Variables

Create `website/.env.local`:

```env
# MySQL
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=<password>
DB_NAME=condition_cover

# Better Auth
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=<random 32+ byte secret>
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Database Migrations

Run all three migrations against `condition_cover` in MySQL CLI:

```sql
USE condition_cover;
SOURCE website/scripts/migrations/001_add_loop_variables.sql;
SOURCE website/scripts/migrations/002_add_loop_sets.sql;
SOURCE website/scripts/migrations/003_add_yield_boost_standard.sql;
```

All three have been applied to the local development database as of 2026-04-02.
